- 👋 Hi, I’m Enrique (Quique) Estrada a.k.a. @oenriqueg
- 👀 I’m interested in Programming, Business Administration, Teaching, and others topics in general.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Python programming (I'm a total newbie, but I'm insterested in solving problems in my actual job. I'm mainly working with excel's reports and SQL queries). I'm also interested in saving time through the use of RPAs for data consolidation, file management, and easy setup of contracts.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with anyone on anything that I can, mainly as Data Analyst (remember, I'm a newbie :P). I've been working during 8 years in contract management, vendor management, financial analysis and 3 years teaching a cloud computing course at college (UNAM).
- 📫 You can reach me through my profiles on Twitter or LinkedIn  (@oenriqueg)
